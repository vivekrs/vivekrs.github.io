Building and Cleansing product data is a source of bread and butter for [Codifyd](http://www.codifyd.com). The Taxonomy and Attribute normalization tool is used to build taxonomy, normalize product data, schemas and controlled vocabularies. Natalie helps a user look at products (SKUs) one taxonomy node at a time, or load SKUs that match a given criteria.

Tree View allows the user to create a product taxonomy and move SKUs between nodes. It also acts as the gateway to look at SKUs one or more nodes at a time. Item View provides an "entity" perspective that allows a value to be associated with an attribute containing more than one name - Web Display Name, Short Name, Long Name, etc and stores attribute names, value, unit-of-measure, etc in one place. Users can normalize attribute names and values across multiple SKUs in batches, thus improving efficiency and consistency while saving time.
